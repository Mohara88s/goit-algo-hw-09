## ‚úÖ Conclusion

##### Greedy algorithm:
 - Very fast, regardless of the amount.

 - The time is almost unchanged - it works in O(n), where n is the number of denominations.

 - But it may not give the optimal answer if the set of coins is "non-standard".

##### Dynamic programming (DP):
 - Guarantees the optimal result - the minimum number of coins.

 - The time increases proportionally to the amount (O(amount √ó len(coins))), that is, linearly with the amount.

 - For large values, it becomes slow, as can be seen from the tests (tens of thousands of times).
